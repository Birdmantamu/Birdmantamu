- Hi, Iâ€™m @Birdmantamu. I've coded a long time ago in C++.  Most recently a couple years ago using machine (G code) for CNC machining and post processors.  This is my first time trying python and learning some code for personal projects.
- Iâ€™m interested in API's, webscraping and code for data/predictive analysis with an emphasis towards sports; particularly american football.
- Iâ€™m currently learning python, API's and webscraping.
- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on sports analysis and predictive/machine learning models.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me = email I guess.  I'm not that great at responding but maybe I will get better with projects here?
